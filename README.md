A linktree clone functonally similar to this https://linktr.ee/. A user can sign up and save links in this website. I used mongoDB as my database.
The user will also be able to edit the links and profile(change name, picture).

So far, i've been able to get the user to sign up and login at will, add links to the user's database and also retrieve the links to display.
I'm stuck at displaying the links on the website.
